### Prompt 1
How do I iterate over all characters in a string in C++17?

### Response 1
In C++17, you can iterate over all characters in a string using a range-based for loop. Here's an example:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

int main() {
    std::string myString = "Hello, World!";

    // Using range-based for loop to iterate over characters in the string
    for (char c : myString) {
        std::cout << c << " ";
    }

    return 0;
}
```
In this example, the `for (char c : myString)` loop iterates over each character in the string `myString`, and the variable `c` takes on the value of each character in turn. The loop body prints each character followed by a space.

This is a concise and readable way to iterate over the characters in a string in C++17.

### Chagnes 1
I only needed the `for` loop part, and my string was named `bar` so I changed it to just:
```cpp
// AI Generated
for (char c : bar) {
```
